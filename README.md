Title of the hack - YOUR DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Description-
1) While taking into the consideration the impact of this cute, sweet project on society that each person can make a track of his daily routine essential works such as learning coding, dieting, earning money (each day), physical fitness, one's knowledge each day with date. Anyone can keep track of it and improve themselves as they want in any spheres of their life.
2) in this hack , I (the admin) makes contribution on writing the codes in "frontend.py" and structuring the website (using HTML) in which we are going to host the our code and output of each option we created in our Project.
My teammate Himanshu handles the coding in "backend.py" and beautifying our website using CSS and Bootstrap and makes his fabulous contribution in this project.
3) The main challenges we face is to connect frontend and backend, and deleting the records if user wants to delete it. But soon after we both are able to figure it out  the bug and did what we planned successfully.
